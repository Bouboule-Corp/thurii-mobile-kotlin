# Good Practice

In addition to the linter and the dependabot, here are some tips for a more maintainable and readable code

## Add your resources to the values folder by
  - string
  - color
  - themes
 
 to allow everyone to have the same base and to avoid duplication.

## Explicit error handling with logs

## A lot of test

Read the documentation at this location : `/docs/unit_test.md`

## File Name in the RES folder

Since in the RES folder we cannot add new folders here are some naming rules for a better readability :

FOLDER-NAME_Sub-file_file-name

Example :     
`HOMEPAGE_Settings_PrivacyPolicyFragment.xml`       
`ICON_NavBar_SearchIcon.svg`
