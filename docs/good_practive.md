# Good Practice

In addition to the linter and the dependabot, here are some tips for a more maintainable and readable code

## Basic

### Add your resources to the values folder by
  - string
  - color
  - themes
 
 to allow everyone to have the same base and to avoid duplication.

### Explicit error handling with logs

### A lot of test (cf `docs/unit_test.md`)
